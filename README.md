# 🐍 Snake Game — x86 DOS Assembly

A fully functional Snake game written in **x86 16-bit Assembly**, running natively in DOS (or DOSBox). Features a custom timer-driven game loop, direct VGA text-mode rendering, hardware interrupt hooking for keyboard input, and ASCII art screens — all in a single `.asm` file compiled as a `.com` executable.

## 🎮 How to Play

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `W` | Move Up |
| `A` | Move Left |
| `S` | Move Down |
| `D` | Move Right |
| `SPACE` | Restart (on Game Over screen) |
| `ESC` | Exit game |

**Objective:** Eat the red apple (`☻`) to grow your snake and increase your score. Avoid hitting the walls or your own body!

## ✨ Features

- **Direct VGA text-mode rendering** — writes to `0xB800` segment directly, no BIOS print calls during gameplay
- **Hardware timer ISR (INT 8h)** — smooth, speed-controlled game loop using the system timer interrupt
- **Hardware keyboard ISR (INT 9h)** — low-latency input via direct scancode reading; prevents 180° reversals
- **Direction-aware snake body** — each body segment displays an arrow (`►` `◄` `▲` `▼`) matching its travel direction, giving the snake a fluid animated look
- **Color-coded visuals:**
  - 🟢 Snake: bright white on **green** background (`0x2F`)
  - 🔴 Apple: bright **red** glowing circle character (`0x4C02`)
- **Tail-tracking via video memory** — no separate array needed; the tail reads its own direction from the video buffer attribute
- **Pseudo-random apple placement** — seeded from the system clock using a linear congruential generator
- **Animated title screen** — ASCII art logo with a character-by-character print delay effect
- **Score tracking** with live display update

## 🛠 Building & Running

### Requirements

- [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) (Netwide Assembler)
- [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) or any real/emulated DOS environment

### Assemble

```bash
nasm snake.asm -f bin -o snake.com
```

### Run

```bash
# Launch DOSBox, then inside DOSBox:
mount c /path/to/your/game/folder
c:
snake.com
```

Or drag `snake.com` into DOSBox directly.

## 🧠 Technical Details

### Memory Layout

The game is compiled as a flat `.com` binary (origin `0x0100`), meaning code and data share a single 64KB segment. All variables are stored inline in the data section.

### Interrupt Hooking

| Interrupt | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `INT 8h` (IRQ0) | System timer — fires ~18.2 times/sec; controls snake speed via tick counter |
| `INT 9h` (IRQ1) | Keyboard — reads raw scancodes from port `0x60`; handles WASD |

Both original ISR vectors are saved and restored on exit to keep the system stable.

### Snake Movement Logic

Movement is entirely handled through direct video memory reads/writes:

1. The **head** writes a new cell with a color attribute encoding direction (`0x2F` + arrow char).
2. The **tail** reads its own cell's character to determine which way it should step next, then clears itself (`0x0720`).
3. **Collision detection** checks the destination cell's attribute — `0x2F_` = snake body = game over; `0x4C02` = apple = eat; `0x0720` = empty = move.

This eliminates the need for a separate snake position array.

### Speed Control

The timer ISR increments a `tick_count`. When it reaches the threshold (default: `2` ticks ≈ ~9 ticks/sec), it sets a `move_snake` flag. The main game loop polls this flag. Lower the threshold value in `INT8_Handler` to increase speed.

Built as a low-level systems programming exercise to explore x86 real-mode assembly, DOS interrupt architecture, and direct hardware interfacing — no OS abstractions, no C runtime, just raw silicon.
